Arithmetic:
Add:3+3
Mult:3*3
Div:3/3
Sub:3-3

Non-Math:
C:prints ascii value of number
o:prints number
r:prints number rounded to nearest integer
<,>,<=,=>,=,!=: Compares two value ex:3=3 IF TRUE add 1 to data if false add 0 to data
Algebra:
Absolute Value:|3|
Radicals:3[27] 3 is root 27 is value
Exponents:3^2

Modulus:3%2
Summation: S 1,3, +1 use S and 1 is start and 3 is end use +and then value can be any operator
Product: Like Summation but multiplies

Linear Algebra:
V1: Create vector1 and add stuff ex:V1 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,; use ; to stop
V2: V1 but for Vector2
VA: adds both vectors and prints value
VCP2: Cross Multiplies vectors in 2d
VCP3: Cross Multiplies vectors in 3d
VM1: Finds Magnitude of Vector 1
VM2: Finds Magnitude of Vector 2
VDP: Dot products vectors and prints value
VC1: prints Vector 1
VC2: prints Vector 2
VT1: Transposes Vector 1
VT2: Transposes Vector 2
